### GitHub Actions
CalPal a program that is designed to parse `.ics` calendar files, extract event details, handle recurring events, and perform various operations on the extracted data, such as sorting events by start time and summing event durations. The program is intended for users who need to manage and analyze calendar events within a specified date range. My main motivation for creating this program was to enable me to easily sum up the amount of work hours I have blocked off on my Google calendar.
