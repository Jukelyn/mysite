Hey there, glad to see you here. My name is Mehraz, but I mostly go by my screen name, Jukelyn (hence the domain name). I'm an aspiring server admin who is currently working in an IT support tech position at the college that I am attending. I'm studying math and computer science at NC State University and hope to work towards a master's in data science as well! In my free time, I love making new projects to further refine my skills as a developer. I was interested in software engineering for quite some time, but I have found myself exploring the sysadmin side more and more in recent times. I'm currently working on maintaining my own server, where I plan to perhaps host some of my projects in the future as well.Â 

Take a look at some of my projects on GitHub:

* [Main page](https://github.com/Jukelyn)
* [CopyCat](https://github.com/Jukelyn/CopyCat/)
* [Bloomify](https://github.com/Jukelyn/bloomify)
* [A Discord Bot](https://github.com/Jukelyn/Jukes-Discord-Bot)

Oh, btw I also hate web dev so I'm using a static site generator called Hugo with the Coder theme. More info on Hugo [here](https://github.com/gohugoio) (you can also click the links in the Copyright info at the bottom of the site).
