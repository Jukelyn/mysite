### Future Projects

* Create a Discord bot (again...)
* Building small games to brush up on my programming skills
* Learning new programming languages. Somewhat interested in C++ and C...

Everything I do will from now on be documented on my site here and I am also considering the possibility of uploading my code to Github publicly so that others can actually have access to things I make!

### Current

Currently I am trying to learn C when I have the time. I am also always working on maintaining my homelab/server. You can follow along on my progress by checking out my [blog posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "Blog") where I will occasionally post about the various things I am setting up and how!


### CalPal -- July 2024
CalPal a program that is designed to parse `.ics` calendar files, extract event details, handle recurring events, and perform various operations on the extracted data, such as sorting events by start time and summing event durations. The program is intended for users who need to manage and analyze calendar events within a specified date range. My main motivation for creating this program was to enable me to easily sum up the amount of work hours I have blocked off on my Google calendar.

### CopyCat -- July 2024
CopyCat is a program that will simply repeat what you say until the end of time (or your battery is drained), nothing too impressive, just a small project I wanted to work on to brush up on my Python Tkinter skills.

More info [here](https://github.com/Jukelyn/CopyCat/).


### SpotiTracker -- Mar 2024

SpotiTracker is a project that I found myself invested in when I wanted more insight on how I compare to other listeners of certain artists on Spotify. There are already many sites that do this but I wanted more than just a handle full of artists that I can compare and see my stats for. This project is on the back burner until I figure out why the Spotify API hates me.

### bloomify -- Sep 2023

bloomify is a project that myself and a couple of others started for a hackathon that I attended last September. The project was not finished and the others have long abandoned the project but I still have the urge to work on it here and there and complete it at some point. The main issue is that I disdain web dev and the project is a web app that is heavy on HTML and JavaScript. I don't mind JS *that* much but the HTML and CSS are such a nuisance to me. You can view information about this project on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Jukelyn/bloomify) where there is some more information on what the project is and the direction I am thinking of taking it.
